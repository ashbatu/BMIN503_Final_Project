# Identifying Screening-Relevant Context in an OSA Study Using Clinical Note Metadata and LLM-Extracted Signals
**Author:** Ashley Batugo

## Overview 

This project examined which note-level contextual and metadata features are associated with clinical research coordinator (CRC) exclusion decisions during screening for an NIH-funded Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) study using LLM extracted note-level evidence, to aggregate these signals into a patient-level dataset. Logistic regression was conducted using the patient-level dataset to identify which metadata features were most associated with both informal and formal exclusionary contexts.
